The text editor allows you to edit and send the scripts that compose the current scene. There are two editing modes available either through the option menu or through keybindings.

## Modes

- `Normal mode` - EMACS based keybindings. Recommended for beginners.
- `Vim Mode` - (Neo-)Vim emulation of modal editing.

By default, the editor will start in `Normal mode`. 

## Common keybindings

* `Ctrl+S` - Send script to the server
* `Ctrl+E` - Enable/Disable the current `frame`
* `Ctrl` + `↑` / `↓` / `←` / `→` : Quick move between `frames`

## Mode specific keybindings

Depending on the mode you are in, keybindings for all basic actions will be different. The normal mode is heavily inspired by EMACS, while the Vim mode is a port of the Vim logic. You are likely to already know the keybindings of at least one of the two. Otherwise, please refer to external documentation for help.
