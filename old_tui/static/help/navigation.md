`SovaTUI` is composed of different menus and panes.

## Available menus

- `Navigation` - A central hub to switch between views.
- `Editor` - A Text Editor used to edit the selected script.
- `Scene` - A Grid used to manipulate the scene currently playing.
- `Options` - A menu to manage the application settings.
- `Devices` - A menu to manage the connected devices (MIDI/OSC).
- `Logs` - A console to display important logs and chat messages.
- `Files` - A menu to save and load projects.
- `Help` - This very menu.

 All views are accessible through keybindings and/or through the navigation grid. For speed and efficiency, navigation is **heavily** based on keyboard shortcuts.
