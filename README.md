# Sova: A Polyglot Sequencer & Virtual Machine for Live Coding

Sova is a brand new sequencer and musical programming environment designed in Rust. It is based on a robust virtual machine that allows to improvise music in real time through code. The virtual machine allows Sova to support multiple bespoke programming languages, each tailored to a specific way of thinking about music or to a specific way of describing and programming music. Sova is free and open-source software, developed for musicians, artists, developers, researchers and teachers alike. It aims to help popularize a creative and musical approach to computer programming, based on improvisation.
