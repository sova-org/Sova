BuboCore is a music creation tool. It is a live coding environment made for algoraves, live coding performances and algorithmic music. BuboCore acts as a central hub to control other instruments and software. The tool is polyglot: it supports multiple programming languages. It is also collaborative, allowing you to jam with your friends. It features a step sequencer like interface meant to organize the execution of `frames` / `scripts`. Each script can be written in any language able to compile to our internal machine language. BuboCore is a machine. BuboCoreTUI (this application) is one of its user-friendly interfaces.

## Architecture

`BuboCore` is composed of two parts:

- A server (`BuboCore`) - manages the environment.
- A client (e.g. `BuboCoreTUI`) - interaction with the environment.

## Where to start?

Start by getting familiar with the interface and the keybindings. Think of BuboCore as a musical instrument, not as a traditional production oriented software. Jam for a while, save your favorite moments, rinse and repeat! You'll know that you've got the hang of it when you'll start to fly around without thinking too much :)
