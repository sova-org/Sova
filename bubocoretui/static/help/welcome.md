BuboCore is a live coding environment made for sequencing and playing sequences of musical events over various devices: synthesizers, drum machines, external software, etc. It uses a familiar step sequencer interface to handle the execution of `steps` / `scripts`.

## Architecture

`BuboCore` composed of two parts:

- `bubocore` - A server that manages the live coding environment.
- `bubocoretui` - A client that allows you to interact with the live environment.
