# Team

Sova is developed by a small team of researchers and musicians in collaboration with and with the support of several institutions in the Pays de la Loire region. This software is a free and _open source_ project, open to external contributions. The project's source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/sova).

### Institutional Support

#### Athenor CNCM

Founded by Brigitte Lallier-Maisonneuve and designated as a CNCM in 2018, Athénor is now directed by composer and guitarist Camel Zekri. Based in the port city of Saint-Nazaire, Athénor works towards the emergence and support of contemporary creation in the region, in the Pays de la Loire and on a national and international scale. Athénor connects territories, artists, and inhabitants, bringing together musical writings and oralities, whether contemporary, experimental, traditional, from jazz, improvised music, or world music.

#### LS2N Laboratory

The Computer Science Laboratory of Nantes (LS2N) was created in January 2017 to significantly advance the visibility of computer science research in Nantes. LS2N mainly results from the merger of the former IRCCyN (Institute of Research in Communications and Cybernetics of Nantes) and LINA (Laboratory of Computer Science of Nantes Atlantique). This young joint research unit brings together the research forces in computer science from three higher education institutions (University of Nantes, Centrale Nantes, IMT Atlantique/Nantes campus), CNRS, and Inria. LS2N is the largest public research unit in Nantes and in the Pays de la Loire region. See: [https://www.ls2n.fr/](https://www.ls2n.fr/).
