# Bali Syntax Documentation

Bali is a small declarative programming language created by Loïg Jezequel. User-friendly documentation for this language can be [found on this page](/docs/core/languages/bali.md). One should view it as a testing ground for the entire Sova ecosystem. It is the first language to have been implemented with Sova, and it is used to validate the design of Sova itself. BaLi language design is explicitely centered on its timing semantics. Time in BaLi is always represented relatively to the [Frame](/docs/core/frame) that holds the program execution. BaLi is capable of interfacing with all the I/O systems provided by Sova: MIDI, OSC and audio engine.
