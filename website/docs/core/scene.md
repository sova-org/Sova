# Scene

A scene is analogous to a "project" in other software. It is what you can save and later retrieve when you wish to work on a piece of music over several [sessions](docs/core/session.md). It is the collection of all scripts, all things that will unfold in time when you press play. A scene is formed by a list of [lines](docs/core/line.md). Each line is defined as a sequence of **frames** that will be played one after the other.
