# Languages

The core concept of Sova is that musicians should not be limited to using a single programming language for live coding. They should not be confronted to a language that offers only a single mental model of how music should be structured, thought about, modelled, written, etc. Instead, Sova is designed to be a multi-language environment, where different languages can be designed or used for different purposes, and where new languages can be easily added. Sova is thus a polyglot environment, designed to host multiple compilers and interpreters. These compilers and interpreters should be designed to leverage the runtime offered by Sova.



There are currently two demonstration languages available in Sova:
- [Bali](bali.md) made by Loïg Jezequel
- [Boinx](boinx.md) made by Tanguy Dubois
